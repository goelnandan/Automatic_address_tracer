# Automatic_address_tracer
Traces postal pincode in the postal address and provides information regarding district/city/state.

We are currently using python modules to implement OCR (namely Pyocr and Pytesseract) part and later applying regex using re module in python.

In later stages we are considering to use more sophisticated methods in order to identify handwritten addresses.

For relevant scripts and dataset, go through repository.
